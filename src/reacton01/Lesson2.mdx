## View Transition events

Astro 3.6 adds these three new events as part of the  router's lifecycle:

astro:before-preparation runs immediately before the preparation step, where the content of the new page is loaded. This can be used to override the behavior of loading the new page, for example, to show a loading spinner.

astro:after-preparation runs after the content has been loaded. This can be used to stop a loading spinner if one was added as part of astro:before-preparation.
